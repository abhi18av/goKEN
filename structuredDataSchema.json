                "Paragraphs":  [
       "\nGood morning. How are you?",
       "(Laughter)",
       "It's been great, hasn't it?\nI've been blown away by the whole thing.\nIn fact, I'm leaving.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "There have been three themes\nrunning through the conference\nwhich are relevant\nto what I want to talk about.\nOne is the extraordinary\nevidence of human creativity\nin all of the presentations that we've had\nand in all of the people here.\nJust the variety of it\nand the range of it.\nThe second is\nthat it's put us in a place\nwhere we have no idea\nwhat's going to happen,\nin terms of the future.\nNo idea how this may play out.",
       "I have an interest in education.\nActually, what I find is everybody\nhas an interest in education.\nDon't you?\nI find this very interesting.\nIf you're at a dinner party,\nand you say you work in education —\nActually, you're not often\nat dinner parties, frankly.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "If you work in education,\nyou're not asked.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "And you're never asked back, curiously.\nThat's strange to me.\nBut if you are, and you say to somebody,\nyou know, they say, \"What do you do?\"\nand you say you work in education,\nyou can see the blood run from their face.\nThey're like, \"Oh my God,\"\nyou know, \"Why me?\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "\"My one night out all week.\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "But if you ask about their education,\nthey pin you to the wall.\nBecause it's one of those things\nthat goes deep with people, am I right?\nLike religion, and money and other things.\nSo I have a big interest in education,\nand I think we all do.\nWe have a huge vested interest in it,\npartly because it's education\nthat's meant to take us into this future\nthat we can't grasp.\nIf you think of it,\nchildren starting school this year\nwill be retiring in 2065.\nNobody has a clue,\ndespite all the expertise that's been\non parade for the past four days,\nwhat the world will look like\nin five years' time.\nAnd yet we're meant\nto be educating them for it.\nSo the unpredictability,\nI think, is extraordinary.",
       "And the third part of this\nis that we've all agreed, nonetheless,\non the really extraordinary\ncapacities that children have —\ntheir capacities for innovation.\nI mean, Sirena last night\nwas a marvel, wasn't she?\nJust seeing what she could do.\nAnd she's exceptional, but I think\nshe's not, so to speak,\nexceptional in the whole of childhood.\nWhat you have there is a person\nof extraordinary dedication\nwho found a talent.\nAnd my contention is,\nall kids have tremendous talents.\nAnd we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.",
       "So I want to talk about education\nand I want to talk about creativity.\nMy contention is that creativity now\nis as important in education as literacy,\nand we should treat it\nwith the same status.",
       "(Applause) Thank you.",
       "(Applause)",
       "That was it, by the way.\nThank you very much.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "So, 15 minutes left.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Well, I was born... no.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "I heard a great story recently\n— I love telling it —\nof a little girl\nwho was in a drawing lesson.\nShe was six, and she was\nat the back, drawing,\nand the teacher said this girl\nhardly ever paid attention,\nand in this drawing lesson, she did.\nThe teacher was fascinated.\nShe went over to her,\nand she said, \"What are you drawing?\"\nAnd the girl said, \"I'm\ndrawing a picture of God.\"\nAnd the teacher said, \"But nobody\nknows what God looks like.\"\nAnd the girl said,\n\"They will, in a minute.\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "When my son was four in England —\nActually, he was four\neverywhere, to be honest.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "If we're being strict about it,\nwherever he went, he was four that year.\nHe was in the Nativity play.\nDo you remember the story?",
       "(Laughter)",
       "No, it was big, it was a big story.\nMel Gibson did the sequel,\nyou may have seen it.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "\"Nativity II.\"\nBut James got the part of Joseph,\nwhich we were thrilled about.\nWe considered this to be\none of the lead parts.\nWe had the place crammed\nfull of agents in T-shirts:\n\"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter)\nHe didn't have to speak,\nbut you know the bit\nwhere the three kings come in?\nThey come in bearing gifts,\ngold, frankincense and myrrh.\nThis really happened.\nWe were sitting there and I think\nthey just went out of sequence,\nbecause we talked to the little boy\nafterward and we said,\n\"You OK with that?\" And he said,\n\"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\"\nThey just switched.\nThe three boys came in,\nfour-year-olds with tea towels\non their heads,\nand they put these boxes down,\nand the first boy said,\n\"I bring you gold.\"\nAnd the second boy said,\n\"I bring you myrrh.\"\nAnd the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "What these things have in common\nis that kids will take a chance.\nIf they don't know, they'll have a go.\nAm I right? They're not\nfrightened of being wrong.\nI don't mean to say that being wrong\nis the same thing as being creative.\nWhat we do know is,\nif you're not prepared to be wrong,\nyou'll never come up\nwith anything original —\nif you're not prepared to be wrong.\nAnd by the time they get to be adults,\nmost kids have lost that capacity.\nThey have become\nfrightened of being wrong.\nAnd we run our companies like this.\nWe stigmatize mistakes.\nAnd we're now running\nnational education systems\nwhere mistakes are the worst\nthing you can make.\nAnd the result is that\nwe are educating people\nout of their creative capacities.",
       "Picasso once said this, he said\nthat all children are born artists.\nThe problem is to remain an artist\nas we grow up.\nI believe this passionately,\nthat we don't grow into creativity,\nwe grow out of it.\nOr rather, we get educated out of it.\nSo why is this?",
       "I lived in Stratford-on-Avon\nuntil about five years ago.\nIn fact, we moved\nfrom Stratford to Los Angeles.\nSo you can imagine\nwhat a seamless transition that was.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Actually, we lived in a place\ncalled Snitterfield,\njust outside Stratford,\nwhich is where\nShakespeare's father was born.\nAre you struck by a new thought? I was.\nYou don't think of Shakespeare\nhaving a father, do you?\nDo you? Because you don't think\nof Shakespeare being a child, do you?\nShakespeare being seven?\nI never thought of it.\nI mean, he was seven at some point.\nHe was in somebody's\nEnglish class, wasn't he?",
       "(Laughter)",
       "How annoying would that be?",
       "(Laughter)",
       "\"Must try harder.\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Being sent to bed by his dad, you know,\nto Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!\nAnd put the pencil down.\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "\"And stop speaking like that.\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "\"It's confusing everybody.\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Anyway, we moved\nfrom Stratford to Los Angeles,\nand I just want to say a word\nabout the transition.\nMy son didn't want to come.\nI've got two kids;\nhe's 21 now, my daughter's 16.\nHe didn't want to come to Los Angeles.\nHe loved it, but he had\na girlfriend in England.\nThis was the love of his life, Sarah.\nHe'd known her for a month.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Mind you, they'd had\ntheir fourth anniversary,\nbecause it's a long time when you're 16.\nHe was really upset on the plane,\nhe said, \"I'll never find\nanother girl like Sarah.\"\nAnd we were rather pleased\nabout that, frankly —",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Because she was the main reason\nwe were leaving the country.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "But something strikes you\nwhen you move to America\nand travel around the world:\nEvery education system on Earth\nhas the same hierarchy of subjects.\nEvery one. Doesn't matter where you go.\nYou'd think it would be\notherwise, but it isn't.\nAt the top are mathematics and languages,\nthen the humanities,\nand at the bottom are the arts.\nEverywhere on Earth.\nAnd in pretty much every system too,\nthere's a hierarchy within the arts.\nArt and music are normally\ngiven a higher status in schools\nthan drama and dance.\nThere isn't an education\nsystem on the planet\nthat teaches dance everyday to children\nthe way we teach them mathematics. Why?\nWhy not? I think this is rather important.\nI think math is very\nimportant, but so is dance.\nChildren dance all the time\nif they're allowed to, we all do.\nWe all have bodies, don't we?\nDid I miss a meeting?",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Truthfully, what happens is,\nas children grow up,\nwe start to educate them progressively\nfrom the waist up.\nAnd then we focus on their heads.\nAnd slightly to one side.",
       "If you were to visit\neducation, as an alien,\nand say \"What's it for, public education?\"\nI think you'd have to conclude,\nif you look at the output,\nwho really succeeds by this,\nwho does everything that they should,\nwho gets all the brownie\npoints, who are the winners —\nI think you'd have to conclude\nthe whole purpose of public education\nthroughout the world\nis to produce university professors.\nIsn't it?\nThey're the people who come out the top.\nAnd I used to be one, so there.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "And I like university\nprofessors, but you know,\nwe shouldn't hold them up\nas the high-water mark\nof all human achievement.\nThey're just a form of life,\nanother form of life.\nBut they're rather curious, and I say this\nout of affection for them.\nThere's something curious\nabout professors in my experience —\nnot all of them, but typically,\nthey live in their heads.\nThey live up there,\nand slightly to one side.\nThey're disembodied, you know,\nin a kind of literal way.\nThey look upon their body as a form\nof transport for their heads.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Don't they?\nIt's a way of getting\ntheir head to meetings.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "If you want real evidence\nof out-of-body experiences,\nget yourself along to a residential\nconference of senior academics,\nand pop into the discotheque\non the final night.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "And there, you will see it.\nGrown men and women\nwrithing uncontrollably, off the beat.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Waiting until it ends so they can\ngo home and write a paper about it.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Our education system is predicated\non the idea of academic ability.\nAnd there's a reason.\nAround the world, there were\nno public systems of education,\nreally, before the 19th century.\nThey all came into being\nto meet the needs of industrialism.\nSo the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.",
       "Number one, that the most useful\nsubjects for work are at the top.\nSo you were\nprobably steered benignly away\nfrom things at school when you\nwere a kid, things you liked,\non the grounds that you would\nnever get a job doing that. Is that right?\nDon't do music, you're not\ngoing to be a musician;\ndon't do art, you won't be an artist.\nBenign advice — now, profoundly mistaken.\nThe whole world\nis engulfed in a revolution.",
       "And the second is academic ability,\nwhich has really come to dominate\nour view of intelligence,\nbecause the universities designed\nthe system in their image.\nIf you think of it, the whole system\nof public education around the world\nis a protracted process\nof university entrance.\nAnd the consequence\nis that many highly-talented,\nbrilliant, creative\npeople think they're not,\nbecause the thing\nthey were good at at school\nwasn't valued,\nor was actually stigmatized.\nAnd I think we can't afford\nto go on that way.",
       "In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,\nmore people worldwide will be graduating\nthrough education\nthan since the beginning of history.\nMore people, and it's the combination\nof all the things we've talked about —\ntechnology and its transformation\neffect on work, and demography\nand the huge explosion in population.",
       "Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.\nIsn't that true?\nWhen I was a student,\nif you had a degree, you had a job.\nIf you didn't have a job,\nit's because you didn't want one.\nAnd I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter)\nBut now kids with degrees\nare often heading home\nto carry on playing video games,\nbecause you need an MA where\nthe previous job required a BA,\nand now you need a PhD for the other.\nIt's a process of academic inflation.\nAnd it indicates the whole\nstructure of education\nis shifting beneath our feet.\nWe need to radically rethink\nour view of intelligence.",
       "We know three things about intelligence.\nOne, it's diverse.\nWe think about the world in all the ways\nthat we experience it.\nWe think visually, we think in sound,\nwe think kinesthetically.\nWe think in abstract terms,\nwe think in movement.\nSecondly, intelligence is dynamic.\nIf you look at the interactions\nof a human brain,\nas we heard yesterday\nfrom a number of presentations,\nintelligence is wonderfully interactive.\nThe brain isn't divided into compartments.\nIn fact, creativity —\nwhich I define as the process\nof having original ideas\nthat have value —\nmore often than not comes about\nthrough the interaction\nof different disciplinary\nways of seeing things.",
       "By the way, there's a shaft of nerves\nthat joins the two halves of the brain\ncalled the corpus callosum.\nIt's thicker in women.\nFollowing off from Helen yesterday,\nthis is probably why women\nare better at multi-tasking.\nBecause you are, aren't you?\nThere's a raft of research,\nbut I know it from my personal life.\nIf my wife is cooking a meal at home —\nwhich is not often, thankfully.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "No, she's good at some things,\nbut if she's cooking,\nshe's dealing with people on the phone,\nshe's talking to the kids,\nshe's painting the ceiling,\nshe's doing open-heart surgery over here.\nIf I'm cooking, the door\nis shut, the kids are out,\nthe phone's on the hook,\nif she comes in I get annoyed.\nI say, \"Terry, please,\nI'm trying to fry an egg in here.\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "\"Give me a break.\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Actually, do you know\nthat old philosophical thing,\nif a tree falls in a forest\nand nobody hears it, did it happen?\nRemember that old chestnut?\nI saw a great t-shirt\nrecently, which said,\n\"If a man speaks his mind\nin a forest, and no woman hears him,\nis he still wrong?\"",
       "(Laughter)",
       "And the third thing about intelligence is,\nit's distinct.\nI'm doing a new book at the moment\ncalled \"Epiphany,\"\nwhich is based on a series\nof interviews with people\nabout how they discovered their talent.\nI'm fascinated\nby how people got to be there.\nIt's really prompted by a conversation\nI had with a wonderful woman\nwho maybe most people\nhave never heard of, Gillian Lynne.\nHave you heard of her? Some have.\nShe's a choreographer,\nand everybody knows her work.\nShe did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\"\nShe's wonderful.\nI used to be on the board\nof The Royal Ballet,\nas you can see.\nAnyway, Gillian and I had\nlunch one day and I said,\n\"How did you get to be a dancer?\"\nIt was interesting.\nWhen she was at school,\nshe was really hopeless.\nAnd the school, in the '30s,\nwrote to her parents and said,\n\"We think Gillian\nhas a learning disorder.\"\nShe couldn't concentrate;\nshe was fidgeting.\nI think now they'd say she had ADHD.\nWouldn't you?\nBut this was the 1930s, and ADHD\nhadn't been invented at this point.\nIt wasn't an available condition.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "People weren't aware they could have that.",
       "(Laughter)",
       "Anyway, she went to see this specialist.\nSo, this oak-paneled room,\nand she was there with her mother,\nand she was led and sat\non this chair at the end,\nand she sat on her hands for 20 minutes\nwhile this man talked to her mother\nabout the problems\nGillian was having at school.\nBecause she was disturbing people;\nher homework was always late; and so on,\nlittle kid of eight.\nIn the end, the doctor\nwent and sat next to Gillian, and said,\n\"I've listened to all these\nthings your mother's told me,\nI need to speak to her privately.\nWait here. We'll be back;\nwe won't be very long,\"\nand they went and left her.",
       "But as they went out of the room,\nhe turned on the radio\nthat was sitting on his desk.\nAnd when they got out, he said to her\nmother, \"Just stand and watch her.\"\nAnd the minute they left the room,\nshe was on her feet, moving to the music.\nAnd they watched for a few minutes\nand he turned to her mother and said,\n\"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian\nisn't sick; she's a dancer.\nTake her to a dance school.\"",
       "I said, \"What happened?\"\nShe said, \"She did. I can't tell you\nhow wonderful it was.\nWe walked in this room\nand it was full of people like me.\nPeople who couldn't sit still.\nPeople who had to move to think.\"\nWho had to move to think.\nThey did ballet, they did tap, jazz;\nthey did modern; they did contemporary.\nShe was eventually auditioned\nfor the Royal Ballet School;\nshe became a soloist; she had\na wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.\nShe eventually graduated\nfrom the Royal Ballet School,\nfounded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,\nmet Andrew Lloyd Webber.\nShe's been responsible for\nsome of the most successful\nmusical theater productions in history,\nshe's given pleasure to millions,\nand she's a multi-millionaire.\nSomebody else might have put her\non medication and told her to calm down.",
       "(Applause)",
       "What I think it comes to is this:\nAl Gore spoke the other night\nabout ecology and the revolution\nthat was triggered by Rachel Carson.\nI believe our only hope for the future\nis to adopt a new conception\nof human ecology,\none in which we start\nto reconstitute our conception\nof the richness of human capacity.\nOur education system has mined our minds\nin the way that we strip-mine the earth:\nfor a particular commodity.\nAnd for the future, it won't serve us.\nWe have to rethink\nthe fundamental principles\non which we're educating our children.",
       "There was a wonderful quote\nby Jonas Salk, who said,\n\"If all the insects\nwere to disappear from the Earth,\nwithin 50 years all life\non Earth would end.\nIf all human beings\ndisappeared from the Earth,\nwithin 50 years all forms\nof life would flourish.\"\nAnd he's right.",
       "What TED celebrates is the gift\nof the human imagination.\nWe have to be careful now\nthat we use this gift wisely\nand that we avert some of the scenarios\nthat we've talked about.\nAnd the only way we'll do it is by seeing\nour creative capacities\nfor the richness they are\nand seeing our children\nfor the hope that they are.\nAnd our task is to educate\ntheir whole being,\nso they can face this future.\nBy the way — we may not see this future,\nbut they will.\nAnd our job is to help them\nmake something of it.",
       "Thank you very much.",
       "(Applause)\n"
